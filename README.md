# 📈 Time Series Forecasting and Visualization Project

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting stock prices using multiple time series models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM). It also includes interactive **Power BI dashboards** for business insights and storytelling.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- 📊 **Goal:** Predict future stock prices and trends using historical data.
- 📅 **Data:** Real-time stock data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) or Kaggle datasets.
- 🧠 **Models Used:**  
  - ARIMA

- 📈 **Visualizations:**  
  - Streamlit-based live charts  
  - Power BI reports for stakeholders
